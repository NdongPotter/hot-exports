This is a custom data exporter based on Osmium.

See the simple MAKEFILE on how to build it.

It takes two filenames on the command line: The first is the name of
an OSM source file, and the second is the name of the destination file
which will be created, through the OGR output driver, in SQLITE format.

The result will have planet_osm_point, planet_osm_line, planet_osm_polygon,
and planet_osm_roads tables compatible with osm2pgsql's database schema.

The program also reads three environment variables - CDE_FIELDS_NODES,
CDE_FIELDS_WAYS, CDE_FIELDS_AREAS - which each contain a comma-separated
list of fields to be included in the output tables.
